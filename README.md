3D Computer Vision &amp; Geometric Reconstruction

· Implemented a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline using Epipolar Geometry, extracting SIFT features and estimating
Fundamental/Essential matrices via RANSAC.

· Reconstructed 3D scene geometry from single 2D images by exploiting Vanishing Points and Homography, applying
Lambertian Shading for realistic rendering.

· Performed Camera Calibration using checkerboard patterns to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
